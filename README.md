### Learning languages fast.

The hardest part of learning a new language is becoming able to communicate with native speakers. Once you are able to communicate with them, it is easy to learn more of the language, and to practice what you already know.

This program is designed to help you overcome this first big barrier of language learning, so that you can start talking in your new language as fast as possible.

In the world of computer languages a typical way of teaching a new language to a computer is called bootstrapping. For example, if a computer knows language A already, and you want to teach it language B, a bootstrap would look like this:
First you use language A to define a handful of words in language B. Then you use the words you already defined in language B to write the rest of language B.

Bootstrapping is popular because the users of language B only need to learn language B. They can even understand the source code of language B, without having to learn any other language.

This program is for bootstrapping with human language.
First you learn a handful of words in your target language, then you use those words to talk to native speakers. The native speakers teach you how to speak properly.
